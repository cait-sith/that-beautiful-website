Embarrassing remarks are prohibited!

This is a website I made for fun after seeing the concept art pictures on the Google+ account of Thomas Romain. Then suddenly Aria the Arietta was announced! Best day of my life. The Python files are there because I'm hosting this on Google App Engine. Fuck me if I know any other good free alternative hosting.

# gitignore
The static files(images and music) are in the gitignore.

# to-do list
Add some tasteful(how?!) links to the source code on Github/credits to Romain-san
